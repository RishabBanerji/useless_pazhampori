 Project Description

Pazham Hub is a playful, interactive parody website themed around Kerala's beloved snack, pazhampori (banana fritters). It features a collection of charmingly useless gadgets, including an unreliable party popper timer, a simulated stock market for fritter prices, and a poetic banana delivery tracker.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The modern pazhampori enthusiast is trapped in a state of high-stakes, low-data anxiety. Vital questions go unanswered: Is my fritter optimally crispy? Is my banana-to-batter ratio financially sound in this volatile market? Is my delivery driver currently composing a sonnet instead of driving? This critical information gap has led to a crisis of confidence in kitchens across Kerala.
The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Pazham Hub confronts this data-void by offering a suite of precision-engineered, non-essential web tools. We empower users by transforming the simple joy of a snack into a complex and entirely absurd digital experience.
AI Judge ü§ñ: Provides definitive, algorithm-driven verdicts on your fritter's quality, removing the burdensome need for personal opinion.
Pazhampori Stock Market üìà: Offers real-time tracking of the banana index, allowing for crucial, albeit completely fictional, financial planning.
Banana Delivery Tracker üöö: Gives unparalleled, poetic insight into your supply chain, answering every question except "Where are my bananas?"
Unreliable Party Timer üéâ: Disrupts cooking-related stress by celebrating every outcome‚Äîperfect or burnt‚Äîwith a mandatory full-screen confetti explosion.
